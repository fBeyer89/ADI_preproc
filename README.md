# ADI Project 

This folder contains preprocessing and analysis scripts for the ADI Study. The ADI study was performed at the Charite University Clinic in Berlin and investigates the effects of bariatric surgery on measures of brain structure and function. 

Three studies have been preregistered on the OSF (https://osf.io/zqgpm/).

The preprint for the head motion project has been published on [bioarxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/766261v1) or [doi](https://doi.org/10.1101/766261).

Another publication in this cohort investigating gray matter differences following bariatric surgery will soon be published by Prehn et al.
