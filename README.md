# ADI Project

This folder contains preprocessing and analysis scripts for the ADI Study. The ADI study was performed at the Charite University Clinic in Berlin and investigates the effects of bariatric surgery on measures of brain structure and function.

### Preprocessing
This folder includes all scripts for file ordering, preprocessing and quality control. Please see `Preprocessing_history.md` and `README.md` for more details about the employed methods.

### Analysis
Three studies have been preregistered on the OSF (https://osf.io/zqgpm/).

1. Project1_headmotion
This project aimed to investigate the link between weight loss and head motion. The preprint for the head motion project has been published on [bioarxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/766261v1) or [doi](https://doi.org/10.1101/766261). The final manuscript was published in [HBM](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hbm.24959).

2. Project2_resting_state
This project aimed to investigate the change in DMN and resting state connectivity after bariatric surgery. Please see `README.md` in this folder for more details.

3. Project3_Hyp_DTI
This project aimed to investigate the change in white matter and hypothalamic microstructure after bariatric surgery. Please see `README.md` in this folder for more details.



Another publication in this cohort investigating gray matter differences following bariatric surgery has been published by [Prehn et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/1/127/pdf).
